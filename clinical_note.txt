    "Patient Name": "Robert Johnson",
    "DOB": "07/15/1960",
    "Date of Service": "2024-12-10",
    "Provider": "Dr. Jane Provider, MD",
    "Chief Complaint (CC)": "Left shoulder pain and limited range of motion.",
    "History of Present Illness (HPI)": (
        "Mr. Robert Johnson is a 64-year-old male presenting with a 3-week history of "
        "progressive left shoulder pain. He reports that the discomfort began after slipping "
        "on ice and catching himself with his left arm extended. Since then, he has experienced "
        "intermittent, dull to sharp pain localized to the anterior and lateral aspects of the "
        "left shoulder. The pain is worse with overhead activities, lying on the affected side, "
        "and during attempts to lift moderately heavy objects. He denies numbness, tingling, or "
        "referred pain down the arm. Over-the-counter NSAIDs have provided only partial relief. "
        "There is no history of recent fevers, unexplained weight loss, or prior shoulder surgeries. "
        "He has no known allergies and no recent changes in his daily activities, aside from avoiding "
        "certain movements due to discomfort."
    ),
    "Review of Systems (ROS)": {
        "Musculoskeletal": "Reports left shoulder pain as described in HPI; denies joint swelling or redness in other joints.",
        "Neurological": "Denies numbness, tingling, or weakness distally in the left arm.",
        "General": "Denies fever, chills, weight loss.",
        "Cardiovascular and Respiratory": "No chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or wheezing.",
        "Other Systems": "All other systems reviewed and negative unless noted above."
    },
    "Vital Signs": {
        "Blood Pressure": "124/76 mmHg",
        "Heart Rate": "76 bpm",
        "Respiratory Rate": "16/min",
        "Temperature": "98.5°F (36.9°C)",
        "Oxygen Saturation": "98% on room air"
    },
    "Physical Examination": {
        "General": "Appears alert and in no acute distress, though guards the left shoulder somewhat when moving.",
        "Left Shoulder": {
            "Inspection": "No visible swelling, redness, or deformity.",
            "Palpation": "Tenderness over the anterior aspect of the left shoulder and mildly over the greater tuberosity region.",
            "Range of Motion": (
                "Forward flexion and abduction limited by about 20% compared to the right shoulder due to pain. "
                "Pain is elicited at approximately 90° of abduction and with internal rotation maneuvers."
            ),
            "Special Tests": (
                "Positive painful arc test at around 80-100° of abduction. Mild discomfort with Neer’s and Hawkins’ "
                "tests suggest possible impingement. No gross instability but difficulty maintaining full abduction "
                "against resistance suggests possible rotator cuff involvement."
            )
        },
        "Cardiovascular": "Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.",
        "Respiratory": "Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi."
    },
    "Results (Prior to Imaging)": (
        "No lab work has been performed at this visit. No prior imaging studies of the shoulder available "
        "for comparison."
    ),
    "Orders": [
        "Order left shoulder X-ray (AP and scapular Y views) to assess bony anatomy and look for any structural abnormalities.",
        "Prescribe a short course of NSAIDs for pain control (as tolerated).",
        "Recommend physical therapy consultation focusing on rotator cuff strengthening, scapular stabilization exercises, and stretching."
    ],
    "Assessment and Plan": {
        "Assessment": (
            "Likely rotator cuff tendinopathy/subacromial impingement secondary to a fall, with ongoing pain "
            "and limited range of motion. Need to rule out subtle fracture or bony abnormalities."
        ),
        "Plan": [
            "Obtain left shoulder X-ray (2 views) to evaluate osseous structures and exclude fractures or significant degenerative changes.",
            "Continue conservative management with NSAIDs and PT referral.",
            "Follow-up in 2-3 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. Consider MRI if X-ray is unremarkable and symptoms persist."
